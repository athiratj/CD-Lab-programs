### Compiler Design Lab Programs.

##### 1. Lexical Analyser using automata
Write a  C program to implement lexical analyzer to identify keywords,identifiers,numbers and operators using automata.Draw an automata to identify the above items, based on the same use if -else to code the edges.
##### 2. Draw an automata to accept the binary strings divisible by five.
Eg.0,5,10,15,20 etc are divisible by five so the automata should accept the binary strings 0,00,0000,.....101,0101,00101....1010,01010,001010......1111,01111,001111.......10100,010100.....
